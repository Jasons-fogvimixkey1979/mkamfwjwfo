Just walked out of Havoc, man, and I swear I’m still in a haze. The theater was this strange cave, echoes of footsteps mixed with crunching popcorn underfoot – my own too, oops. I was in there, my back aching like I'd been sitting on a rock, but man, what a ride. The main guy... what was his name again? He’s this relentless force, like a bull in a china shop but with, you know, a lot more blood and intensity.

In the middle of the  , like when they’re smashing through that glass – or like, was it paper walls? – I kind of felt my brain do the same thing. All shattery. Someone spilled their drink and it was this tidal wave of ice and syrup under the seats. Sticky and weird. Anyway, that sequence when he’s just laying waste to an entire room, it’s like the world's most chaotic ballet… or like a washing machine full of knives.

> Oh! Remembered to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ; I think you can probably 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 now or something. It's a wild mess! People dodging furniture being used like projectile missiles, and I’m just ducking in my seat like it’s coming at me, too.

Random thought, his fists are like metaphors. Reality? Hmm, there's a likelihood that's not making any sense. It's like imagining your laundry detergent having a boxing match with your clothes. Yeah, sorry, never been good with clear examples. 

I kept thinking about how everything in the  ’s crumbling, just everyone screaming, a bit like those awful upstairs neighbors having a midnight shout-off while you’re trying to sleep... but kinda captivatingly awful. That's the chaos in Havoc. It's like every part is chewing up the scenery, the actors, the lighting – everything.

Some dude walked out halfway through; guess the noise wasn’t his scene. I stayed coz you asked me, right? You got to love the choreography thought, like how people direct traffic but with fists and boots. I need to stretch my back now; the seats were killer—both to me and in the  .

function makeChaosTheoryDance(punch, kick) {
  return punch  kick; 
} 

Anyway, still buzzing. Gotta process this.
